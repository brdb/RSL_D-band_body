\opening{Dear Editor-in-Chief, \\Dear Associate Editor, \\Dear Reviewer,} 


It is my pleasure to submit our paper entitled ``On-Body Path Loss Modeling in the 110 to 170~GHz Frequency Range" to Radio Science Letters. 
In this paper, which is an extension of the paper that I presented at URSI-AT-AP-RASC 2022 (entitled ``Outdoor Channel Modeling at Sub-THz Frequencies for Future Fixed Wireless Access Applications''), we model on-body path loss at Sub-THz frequencies in the D-band (ranging from 110 to 170~GHz) via measurements on a skin phantom.
Not only is it the first time that on-body path loss measurements are performed above 100~GHz, but also are the antenna separations very small compared to existing literature.

I declare that I am the corresponding author of this manuscript. 
I agree to submit this paper to Radio Science Letters. 
The content of this manuscript is my own work and has not been previously published, under submission or currently in press in any other journal. 
I certify that the intellectual content of this work is the product of my own work and that all the assistance received in preparing this manuscript have been acknowledged. 


\closing{With kind regards, \\Brecht De Beelde}
